Turn Excel Into a Beautiful Web Application Using Streamlit

Objective: Solve challenges using Excel for Data Science Projects

The difficulty in presenting the findings from data science and Excel projects is a concern (a.k.a production deployment). 
You will either need to link an excel file with visualization software like Power BI, Tableau, or Powerpoint in order to present it.


While a data science project requires the implementation of a front-end user interface (UI) using React and Vue.js as well as a back-end server like Django or Flask.
Data sharing with Excel initiatives and data science projects are made incredibly tedious and boring by these issues.
